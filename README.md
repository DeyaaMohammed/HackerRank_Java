## Introduction

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a platform for practicing and mastering coding skills through fun and interactive challenges. This repository serves as a collection of my Java solutions to various HackerRank problems.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory, contains Java source code files. These files represent my own implementations to solve the problems.
    - `XXX_XXXX_XXXXX/`: Each problem has its own package, and the package name corresponds to the problem's name on HackerRank, with spaces replaced by underscores.
      - `Solution.java`: This Java file contains my implementation to solve the HackerRank problem. It includes the logic and code required to address the specified challenge.

## Key Features

**Multiple approaches (where applicable):** Some problems might showcase alternative solutions with varying levels of complexity or efficiency.\
**Tested and verified:** Each solution is verified against the original HackerRank test cases.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have alternative solutions, suggestions for improvements, or corrections to my answers, please consider submitting a pull request. If you encounter any issues with my solutions or have additional insights to share, please open an issue.

## Disclaimer

> These solutions are intended for educational purposes and personal reference only. Sharing them directly for submission to HackerRank challenges is discouraged, as it undermines the platform's learning value.
